## Knowledge base

This project was bootstrapped with the Typescript tempalte of [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and added Eslint, CircleCI, and Enzyme testing utility.

Current React.js version: `v17.0.1`, but Enzyme is set up for `v16` - this will be upgraded when Enzyme releases a new version.
